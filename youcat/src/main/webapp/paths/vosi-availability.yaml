    summary: VOSI Availability full check
    description: |
        Perform a complete check that the service is operational. This normally
        includes checking the availability of back end resources (e.g. database,
        storage, ...) and that other services that this service depends on (e.g. AAI 
        services) are reachable (via heartbeat availability check).
