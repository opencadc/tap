    summary: VOSI Availability full check
    description: |
        Perform a complete check that the service is operational. This normally
        includes checking the availability of back end resources (e.g. database,
        storage, ...) and that other services that this service depends on (e.g. AAI 
        services) are reachable (via heartbeat availability check).

    summary: (CADC extension) modify the state (availability) of a running service
    description: |
        An operator can modify the state of a service instance to put it into one of
        three modes: offline, read-only, and read-write (normal). The detailed meaning of
        these modes depends on the nature of the service.
    parameters:
        - name: STATE
          in: query
